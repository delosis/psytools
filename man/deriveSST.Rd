\description{
Applies to the
\href{https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.91.3.295}{Stop Signal Task}
task implemented in Psytools.
}
\details{
Clearly there are some people who are simply not responding for big chunks
of this task in c-VEDA. This gives them a good stop hit rate but very bad
go_success rate. They will probably need to be excluded. Really this should
not be happening in a supervised admin situation?
